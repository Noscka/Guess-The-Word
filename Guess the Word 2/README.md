# Guess the word Exercise 2
## Introduction
Refer to Exercise 1, it is the same idea, but Player 2 has infinite guesses until they say “guess”
## Changes
I changed the for loop to a while loop as that allowed for conditional stop. I made it so that if Player 2 enters “guess”. It makes the while loop bool false, so the loop stops. Once the loop stops, player 2 has to guess the whole word
